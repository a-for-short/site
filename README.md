🌐 Personal Website

A hand-crafted personal website.
No frameworks. No generators. No magic.
Just HTML, CSS, and intent.

This repository contains the source code for my personal website — a quiet corner of the internet where I write, experiment, and showcase things I care about.

✨ Philosophy
 • 🧱 Built by hand — no Jekyll, no Hugo, no React
 • ✍️ Content first — typography, rhythm, whitespace
 • 🎛 Full control — every pixel and every line is intentional
If something looks simple, it’s because the complexity was removed — not ignored.

⸻

🎨 Design Notes
 • Careful typography
 • Monochrome-first palette with subtle accents
 • Responsive without screaming “responsive”
