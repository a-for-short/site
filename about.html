        Hi there!
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of you may know me as a-for-short from wherever, because this is a common nickname for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        About a year ago I had a website with this domain. The thing is: all of the files of my older website were wiped down because of some file system bug and I stopped paying for the VPS etc. The decision to revive this website came from the sole idea of free hosting a friend of mine offered.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only current feature of the website is a <a href="articles.html">static blog</a>, but this may change in the future. There's certainly a lot of inspiration around. Just look at <a href="https://mc.slean.cc">what mr. Black has launched</a> recently.
    </p>

        So yeah, lots of stuff incoming.

        Added this paragraph specifically to test is the webhook works.
