        Just a short note because I am feeling proud as I had an idea and actually realised it.

        I thought that it is not of much convenience for me to use scp to copy files onto the server. git push is much more powerful. It provides with:
        <ul>
            <li>
                version control;
            </li>
            <li>
                a free back-up;
            </li>
            <li>
                it's cross-platform as is;
            </li>
            <li>
                and arguably it's more convenient, at the very least, concise.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Idea is quite simple: as you push to github, it sends an http notification to server and it does smth. Pulls in my case.
        Took smth like 2 hours for me to make in spite DeepSeek's help.

        Feel like I've learned a lot.
