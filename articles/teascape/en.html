    <p class="lead">
        Happy new year, everybody! As a student I have exams session the whole January. Now that's what I call holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that amount of sparetime I had to do a project. Having started numerous, I'll now tell you about a tea-related one.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem statement</h2>
    <p>
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey_tea">Wikipedia</a> contains interesting informaion about the Earl Grey blend. It states that the original Earl Grey was not flavoured assam tea but rather was a mix of
        <ul>
            <li>
                assam
            </li>
            <li>
                DianHong
            </li>
            <li>
                Darjeeling
            </li>
            <li>
                and even Lapsang tea.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course I was not able to find an original recipe so I thought I should conduct an experiment to find out what the proportions should be for the blend to taste the best.
    </p>
    <h2>Experimental</h2>
    <p>
        All I had to do was randomize some percentages. I carefully weighed the ingredients and mixed the with bergamot oil (anout 6 drops per 25 g of tea). You can see the resulting mixes in a table below. The columns' and rows' names are clickable. Definetely try them out!
    </p>
    <table id="tea-table">
        <thead></thead>
        <tbody></tbody>
    </table>
    <div id="chart-wrapper">
        <canvas id="radarChart"></canvas>
    </div>
    <script src="mixes_table_visual_en.js"></script>
    
    <p>
        I tracked reviews with a google form.
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        <b>The main observation:</b> there is a strong positive correlation between the amount of assam tea in blend and the total score, strong negative between the percentage of darjeeing and mark and not-so-clear with lapsang and dian hong.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each mix I calculated the entropy. I defined it as a negative sum of mass percentage times  logarithm of mass persentage analogous to Claude Shannon's definition (see below). Unfortunately, turns out there is only weak negative correlation. 
    </p>
    <!--
        $S = sum_i w_i log(w_i)$<entropy>
    -->
    <div class="equation">
      <img src="assets/svg/entropy.svg" alt="S = sum_i w_i log(w_i)">
    </div>
    <p>
        The final rating is as follows: 5>2>1>3>4. Haven't tested the 6th yet and not really planning to. Maybe later though.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This is quite amusing as there is room for interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the assam-mark correlation is the strongest positive because of the sample of people.That is my family) This is quite limiting as a) they have similar taste  b) they drink a lot of store-bought Earl Grey. This made me think that while degustating they did not give a mark per se but rather a score of similarity to the industrial Earl Grey.
    </p>

        If you ask me, mix #5 turned out to be my favourite. It is the only one I found to incorporate darjeeling organically.
